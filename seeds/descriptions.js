  "We stayed here for several nights in mid-July. The park is beautiful, with lots of trees and a lake. Our sight was a bit narrow, but there was a row of trees on each side of our site, so we had privacy. The park is kept clean. They had an issue with Canadian geese (way too many!) that would wander through the sites, settle, and make themselves quite at home. But I noticed staff driving through with a water truck cleaning up after the geese. A long-term resident told me that they were working with the state wildlife officials to relocate the geese.",
  "I loved the walking trail that surrounds the park. Very pleasant, with just enough challenge to make it fun. Also loved that the park is quiet, not much road noise at all. Would definitely stay here again. But note, this park is often full, so make reservations way in advance of your stay.",
  "We recently stayed here for multiple nights. The park is beautiful and lush. The staff was friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again. If you're able, bring a leaf blower. Because of the lake, there are geese everywhere and so is there poop. We used our blower to keep our spot free of their droppings.",
  "Lots of greenery in this park. The sites are pretty narrow but our site had a nice 7 ft hedge on both sides to provide some privacy. They have full hookups, it's clean, and relatively quiet. There's lots to do around here - breweries, wineries, eateries, etc.  No freeway or train noises- bonus for us! I would come back.",
  "Great place to visit if you can get a reservation (which is challenging as they book out far in advance). The groundskeepers and on site staff are very nice to work with. I've visited the springs several times and have not experienced the office staff to be particularly pleasant or helpful to interact with. Other than the occasional impatience and rudeness, it's a good organization to deal with overall and the site itself is lovely.",
  "Dope camping spot. I'm absolutely obsessed. Great hiking trails. Nice store if you forget anything. Every site has a fire pit and everything is first come first serve which is awesome.",
  "Just went today after the rain. Lots of snow not even far from my neighborhood. I always go to big bear or crestline, but tried this spot and it didn't disappoint. Not even packed at all.",
  "Camped here last year in August and this year in September with a bunch of friends and it was a blast. I love how local it is and how spaced out the sites are. Both times we came the weather was great, no too hot during day time and very cool at night.",
  "Awesome hiking here! They have different trails from easy to strenuous. I did the one labeled moderately strenuous and thought it was pretty easy. The beginning was steep, that's probably why it's labeled as such, but once you get past the first 15 minutes or so after that it's not too bad. The downhill is not very steep, easy peezy.",
  "The trail is wide at points and also single file with loose rocks under foot. The entire trail is without shade. At the start of the hike for about a mile, the ascension is pretty steep. But after this portion, the climb is pretty steady.",
  "It says there are 8 spots. First come first serve, I think I only saw 7. You only need an Adventure Pass to camp here (you can pick one up at the ranger station, sport chalet, rei day use is $5, yearly $30), meaning the campground itself is free. There are 4 vault toilets. Decent and they had toilet paper. Each site had a campfire ring and a picnic table.",
  "The drive to the campground is a little rocky but do-able in a regular car. There are about 9 first come, first serve spots (Adventure Pass required), pit toilets which are super gross (going in nature is recommended), lots of hiking trails close by and dogs are allowed. I loved this campground for a mini getaway.",
  "Cozy little campground nestled in between the local ski resorts. Offers nice panoramic views of the surrounding region and magnificent viewings of the sunrise/sunsets. Overall, a local favorite for a quick jaunt away from town. Has vault bathrooms available to use and quite a few spaces with picnic tables available at most sites. Just be sure to have your adventure pass on display and you're set.",
  "We enjoyed the campground, especially the clean flush toilets .  The quiet hours of 10pm -7am was not honored.  We were kept awake till 2 pm by a very large group near us.  They didn't think to whisper at all.  Our Bear box was filthy.",
  "Came back again to reserved 6 spots. Our experienced are way better than the first time. Not only the place is amazing, our caretaker is so cool and very accommodating. They have enough place for a big family or for a Friends and family gathering. I will definitively come back again next summer.",
  "A nice park to visit. Some breathtaking scenery. The trails could be a little treacherous for older folks like us as there are lots of loose rocks on pathways. I didn't see any path that would be wheelchair accessible. The campground had some wide sites, however only electric hookup is available. There is a dump site though. Trailheads all had a portapotty.",
  "This is a nice park with a 1.7 mile paved walking trail that goes around the lake. They usually have a lot of activities-check their website to sign up. I would not venture into the woods too much, I have seen a few snakes here and there. There is a warning for alligators however I have not seen one myself. The park is well kept, grass is cut, trees are trimmed, improvements are always made. For example I see a raised garden that was recently built.",
  "One of my favorite spots to walk/jog/hang out at! If you choose to follow the trail, the entire loop is 1.7 miles. There is plenty of shade throughout the course of the trail and so much beauty. You will also come across plenty of people there for fishing, kayaking, etc. I have yet to bring a kayak out there, but it is on my list!",
  "I've only stayed in the West Loop and only in Site 73. This site is large and on a corner. It slopes to the front (street) pretty good. Bring leveling blocks for the front of your RV. The site is very deep and should accommodate the largest of RVs. The site has 50 amp power, water and sewer with partial shade at the back.",
  "Wonderful location! Easy to hook up, and dump. Just the most adorable and friendly staff. It was our first long haul as a family with the RV and the staff made everything warm and welcoming. Highly recommend!",
  "The place is no frills, and quiet in the campground. The lot is a coral type gravel and was great keeping the sand/dirt from coming into the RV. The Shower (1 stall) was not separated from the restaurant guests, except by a small shower curtain. No privacy at all. I chose to shower in my RV. Full hook-ups a plus. Access to the food, music and bar is a great plus. Live music stops \"about\" 10pm. Very reasonable.",
  "Extraordinary guides! I took a 3 day backpacking trip with DBA and Dave, Jess, and Alex were knowledgeable, fun, and deeply connected to the forest. I had some natural outdoor fears but their compassion and expertise helped me feel at ease in the backcountry.",
  "The trails are perfect with a hidden-in-plain-sight feel. We went there on a weekend and spotted two deer, in an wooded area that felt so secluded that you forget for a moment that the parking area is filled with the beautiful sounds of bomba.",
  "A huge spot with diverse terrain, reachable from the 6 train. If you wanted to make a Blair Witch reboot there are woodsy and swampy areas to peruse. One bathroom was closed, the other was reprehensible.",
  "Such a lovely lovely park, and very easy to get to - it took us 30 minutes by car! It's incredible how green and natural it is despite being so close. Our dog went crazy for the woods- she was able to track down two deer, something we used to have to drive way upstate to do! Picnic area is lovely as well, with plenty of benches and shade."
